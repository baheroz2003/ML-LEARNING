# AI>ML>DEEP LEARNING
# artificial intelligence is a branch of cs that is
# concerned with building smart and intelligent machines
#machine learning is atechnique to implement ai that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed
#deep learning is a subfield of ml that uses ann to learn from the data
#ann that is artificial neural network is a mathematical model
#in supervised learning,the ml algorithm learns from labelled data
#in unsupervised learning,the ml algorithm learns from unlabelled data
#reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agaents take actions in an environment to maximize it rewards that are environment,agent,action and the last one is reward 
#types of supervised learning is classification and regression in which classification is about predicting a class or discrete value.for eg male and female ,true or false
#suppose we have to identify it is dog or cat that can be used in classification
#in regression for this temperature there will be how much rainfall in cm that is in decimal value
#classification includes:decision tree classification,random forest classification,k-nearest neighbour
#regression includes logistic,polynomial,supoort vector
#types of unsupervised learning includes clustering(grouping similar data points) and association(find relationship between data points)
#in clustering we have user data ,there we have different cluster for each data based on the user exeprience
#in association we have some data from which we predict relation for other data
#in which we have kmeans clustering,heirarichal clustering,principal component analysis,apriori,and eclat
#deep learning uses ann
#there we have defined layers are input layer,hidden layer 1,hidden layer 2,output layer
#deep learning is faster than machine learning because it combines feature extraction+classification both at single step
#deep mind is a company which primilarly uses deep learning and it creates game like chess 
#using it you can detect diabetic retinopathy or not
#application of deep learning are healthcare,autonomous car(tesla),computer vision that is image processing technique and natural language processing like chatbot like siri
