#why python is best for data science
#beginner friendly
#versatile and flexible
#most popular in machine learning world
#most mature package libraries around
#easy to code
#different ides jupyter notebook,pycharm,colab
#variables is a name given to memory location
#example:x=2
#del (x)
#print(x)
#learn some operator i.e ==,!=,<,>
#%whos tell you value of the variables not,or,and also
#round function is also there
#divmod(27,5) will tell u about the quotient and reminder in tuple
#isinstance(3,int)=>it will return true
#power function as->2**4 or pow(2,4)
#pow(x,y,z) will give x to power y and remainder z
#i.e xtoy%z
#input is used to take input
#help(function name )it will tell you how to use
#control flow includes if else and elif with this
#symbol :
#proper indentation should be followed
#nested it also there
#while loop  syntax:
# n=input('max iterations')
# i=1
# while(i<n):
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
# print('done')
#pass is used to don't do at exact lets it be incrementing,just move on i.e do nothing
#break is used to exit the loop
#continue to skip the iteration
#l=[]
# for i in range(1,n,step):
#     print(i)
#     L.append(i**2)
# print(L)
#suppose we have a list where we have to find minimum
# l=[1,2,4]
# m=l[0]
# for i in l:
#     if i<m:
#         m=i
# print(m)
#the function is a block of code that can be reused in a program
# x=int(input('enter yhe number'))
# def fact(x):
#     if(x==0 or x==1):
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return x*fact(x-1)
